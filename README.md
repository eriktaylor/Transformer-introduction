# Transformer
This is an overview of the transformer architecture with emphasis on vision, language, or multi-modal models. I'll include my articles to introduce the topics and mini-projects that span my interests in vision, foundation models, LLMs, and generative AI. 

## Introduction
The Transformer is a general purpose architecture used for machine learning. It is a general purpose algorithm that powers recent generative AI applications. I'll focus on the basics and build up to large multi-modal models with an emphasis on open-source or open-weight models, where possible. This is an overview about how the transformer or other competitive neural network architectures are used for these applications.
