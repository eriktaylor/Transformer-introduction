# Transformer
This is an overview of the transformer architecture with emphasis on vision, language, or multi-modal models. I will include my articles to introduce the topics and mini-projects that span topics including vision, foundation models, LLMs, and generative AI. 

## Introduction
The Transformer is a general purpose architecture used for machine learning. It powers many recent generative AI applications. Here the focus is on the basics and building up to large multi-purpose models. I will cover what the transformer is used for and how-to with code using open-source or open-weight models, where possible.
